# Template Documentation

This directory contains all the documentation-related code for this template. It includes data structures, components, and pages that showcase the template's features, technologies, and roadmap.

## Purpose

The template documentation system is designed to:

- Help developers understand what technologies are included and why
- Showcase implemented features and their current status
- Provide a roadmap for future development
- Offer setup guides and best practices
- Demonstrate the template's capabilities

## Removing Template Documentation for Production

When you're ready to use this template for your own project, you'll want to remove all the template documentation to avoid confusion and reduce bundle size.

### Complete Removal Steps

1. **Delete the entire template-docs directory:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf src/lib/template-docs/
   ```

2. **Remove template documentation routes:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf src/routes/(template-docs)/
   ```

3. **Remove template documentation assets:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf static/template-docs/
   ```

4. **Clean up navigation components:**
   - Remove template documentation links from navigation components
   - Remove any template-specific sections from the main page
   - Look for comments marked with "TEMPLATE DOCS" for easy identification

5. **Remove template documentation dependencies:**
   - Check if any packages were installed specifically for template documentation
   - Remove unused imports and dependencies

6. **Update configuration files:**
   - Remove any template documentation environment variables
   - Clean up any template-specific build configurations

### Verification Checklist

After removal, verify that:

- [ ] The application builds successfully
- [ ] All existing functionality still works
- [ ] No broken links or missing imports
- [ ] Navigation works correctly
- [ ] No template-specific content appears in production

### Gradual Removal

If you prefer to remove template documentation gradually:

1. **Hide template sections:** Set environment variables to hide template documentation
2. **Remove specific sections:** Delete individual components or pages as needed
3. **Keep useful parts:** Adapt any useful components for your own documentation needs

## Environment Variables

You can control template documentation visibility using environment variables:

```bash
# Show/hide template documentation (default: true in development)
SHOW_TEMPLATE_DOCS=false

# Template documentation base URL (for links and assets)
TEMPLATE_DOCS_BASE_URL=/template-docs
```

## Development Notes

- All template documentation code is isolated in this directory
- Components use the `template-docs/` namespace for easy identification
- Assets are stored in `static/template-docs/` for clear separation
- Routes use the `(template-docs)` group for organization

## Contributing to Template Documentation

If you're contributing to the template itself (not using it for your project):

1. Follow the established patterns in the data files
2. Add new technologies to `data/technologies.ts` with proper categorization
3. Update features in `data/features.ts` when implementing new functionality
4. Keep the roadmap current in `data/roadmap.ts`
5. Ensure all new components are properly typed using the interfaces in `types.ts`

## Questions?

If you have questions about the template or need help with removal:

1. Check the setup guide at `/guide` (when implemented)
2. Review the roadmap at `/roadmap` (when implemented)
3. Open an issue in the template repository
4. Join the community discussions
